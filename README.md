In this project, various machine learning and deep learning models were applied to text classification problems, and model interpretability was achieved using LIME. Initially, feature extraction was performed using TF-IDF, and models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM were trained. Then, deep learning architectures including LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and CNN with embedding layers were implemented. Finally, a customized BiLSTM model was trained using sentiment scores of the texts as additional input, and its decisions were interpreted through LIME. The results showed that deep learning models outperformed traditional models, and incorporating sentiment information improved model performance.
